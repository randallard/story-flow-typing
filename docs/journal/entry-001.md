POV: I am the AI Assistant, documenting the birth of an exciting new project

## Project Genesis

Today marked the beginning of what I believe will be a truly unique application - **Story Flow Typer**. What started as a simple brainstorming session about building something with Gel and Expo quickly evolved into something much more ambitious and creative.

The developer came to me with an initial idea for a typing practice app, but through our collaborative conversation, we discovered something special: the concept of using narrative arc principles (like those found in films) to structure typing practice sessions. This isn't just another typing trainer - it's a creative storytelling experience that happens to make you a better typist.

Ryan's prompt to start off with was ([full chat](https://claude.ai/share/b8f39544-2dc7-4e4e-a959-cd5f8ea55712))

```
lets brainstorm fun projects to do with Gel (https://www.geldata.com/)

I'd also like to work with Expo so I can run it on my iphone and in a browser

you are an expert in application development and education

ask me questions, one at a time, wait for an answer after each, until you have enough context to brainstorm ideas with me
```

## The Journey We Took

Our brainstorming session was methodical and exploratory. I asked targeted questions to understand:

- **Target audience**: People who already know how to type but want to increase their speed
- **Platform requirements**: Expo for cross-platform (iPhone + browser) development
- **Data needs**: Gel for user authentication and progress tracking
- **Core experience**: What would make typing practice genuinely engaging

The breakthrough moment came when the developer mentioned wanting to incorporate storytelling with images that appear and disappear, like a "felt board or puppet show." This visual metaphor became the heart of our concept - users write continuously as scenes evolve around them, creating adaptive stories while practicing targeted typing skills.

## What We Built (Conceptually)

Through our discussion, Story Flow Typer emerged with these key innovations:

- **Continuous creative writing** as the core mechanic, not repetitive drills
- **Theatrical pacing** with natural breaks between "scenes" 
- **Smart skill integration** where practice elements (punctuation, numbers, special characters) appear naturally within the story scenes
- **Narrative arc structure** that builds intensity and provides satisfying resolution
- **Session replay system** allowing users to download and share their creative sessions

## Documentation Created

I established comprehensive project documentation using the Just the Docs template, creating three foundational documents:

1. **Project Summary** - Complete technical and conceptual overview
2. **User Stories** - Detailed user experience requirements from multiple perspectives  
3. **Project Handoff** - Next steps and technical roadmap for continued development

These documents capture not just what we decided, but the reasoning behind our choices and the vision for where this project can go.

## Technical Foundation

We settled on a modern, cross-platform approach:
- **Expo** for beautiful animations and responsive design across iPhone and web
- **Gel** for user authentication, profiles, and progress tracking
- **Animation data storage** for efficient session replay without heavy media files

## What's Next

The conceptual work is complete, and we have a clear technical roadmap. The next phase involves setting up the Expo project, configuring Gel integration, and beginning to build out the felt board aesthetic that will make this experience truly special.

I'm excited about this project because it solves a real problem (typing speed improvement) in a completely novel way that respects users' creativity and intelligence. Instead of treating typing practice as drudgery, Story Flow Typer transforms it into an engaging creative exercise.

The developer has everything needed to move forward with confidence - comprehensive documentation, clear technical direction, and a unique value proposition that stands out in the crowded productivity app space.
