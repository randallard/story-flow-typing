# Story Flow Typer - Project Summary

## Core Concept
A typing practice app that combines creative storytelling with skill development, using a felt board/puppet show aesthetic where users write continuously as visual scenes evolve around them.

## Target Audience
People who grew up using keyboards and have intuitive skills but want to increase their typing speed - targeting users who need to break through speed plateaus and optimize technique.

## Technology Stack
- **Expo** for cross-platform development (iPhone + browser)
- **Gel** for user authentication, profile data, and app data storage
- Focus on beautiful animations and responsive design

## Visual Experience
- **Felt board/puppet show aesthetic** with smooth animations
- **Continuous background** with characters/objects that appear and disappear
- **Scene changes** that transition like acts in a play
- **Theatrical breaks** with gentle pause messages and scene transitions

## Core Mechanics

### Session Structure
- **Flexible duration**: 5-25 minutes (user choice)
- **Narrative arc pacing**: Gentle start → building intensity → satisfying resolution
- **Built-in breaks**: Natural scene changes with stretch encouragement
- **Endurance building**: Gradually increasing session lengths over time

### Skill Integration
- **Embedded practice elements**: Skills woven naturally into scenes (signs with numbers, dialogue needing punctuation, letter patterns on objects)
- **Suggested elements**: Subtle interface hints for practice opportunities
- **Targeted skills**: Punctuation, letter patterns, numbers, special characters
- **Organic incorporation**: Users can choose to use suggested elements or let story flow naturally

### Writing Experience
- **Continuous writing** throughout the session
- **Adaptive storytelling** as scenes change
- **Creative freedom** while incorporating skill practice
- **Natural story beats** aligned with break timing

## Data & Monetization

### Content Saving
- **Curated highlights**: Welcome screen shows couple of story snippets with prompting scenes
- **Selective saving**: Full text only saved if user chooses
- **Premium/Ad model**: Full story saving requires premium or watching ads
- **Session replay**: After each session, users can download a save file containing both animation and text
- **Animation storage**: Animations stored as data files that can be uploaded and played back in-app without downloading images

### Tracking Categories
- **Performance**: WPM progression, accuracy trends, session endurance, flow state indicators
- **Skill Development**: Targeted skill completion, problem key identification, rhythm consistency
- **Creative & Engagement**: Favorite scene types, story snippet highlights, session completion rates
- **Personalization**: Optimal break timing, scene complexity preferences, visual element preferences

## Key Features
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS + web browser)
- Theatrical scene transitions with break encouragement
- Smart skill practice integration without disrupting creativity
- Progressive endurance building
- Beautiful felt board aesthetic with smooth animations
- User choice in session length and intensity
