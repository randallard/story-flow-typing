# Story Flow Typer - User Stories

## Authentication & Profile Management

**As a new user**, I want to create an account easily so that my progress is saved across devices.

**As a returning user**, I want to log in quickly so that I can continue where I left off.

**As a user**, I want to see my typing improvement over time so that I feel motivated to continue practicing.

## Session Setup & Customization

**As a user**, I want to choose my session length (5-25 minutes) so that I can fit practice into my available time.

**As a user**, I want to customize my session settings (length, break frequency, art style, and theme) so that I can tailor the practice experience to my preferences and needs.

**As a beginner to the app**, I want shorter initial sessions so that I can build endurance gradually.

**As an improving user**, I want the app to suggest longer sessions as my endurance builds so that I can challenge myself appropriately.

**As a user**, I want to see my recent story snippets on the welcome screen so that I'm reminded of my creative progress.

## Core Typing Experience

**As a writer**, I want to type continuously while scenes change around me so that I stay in a creative flow state.

**As a user working on specific skills**, I want subtle hints about practice opportunities (punctuation, numbers, special characters) so that I can improve targeted weaknesses without breaking my creative focus.

**As a storyteller**, I want the freedom to incorporate or ignore suggested practice elements so that I maintain creative control over my narrative.

**As someone prone to fatigue**, I want natural break points with gentle encouragement to stretch so that I can practice longer without strain.

## Visual & Aesthetic Experience

**As a user**, I want beautiful, smooth animations in a felt board style so that the experience feels warm and engaging rather than clinical.

**As a storyteller**, I want scenes that evolve naturally (characters appearing/disappearing, backgrounds changing) so that I'm inspired to adapt my story creatively.

**As a user taking breaks**, I want theatrical scene transitions that feel like natural story beats so that breaks don't disrupt my immersion.

## Progress & Motivation

**As a competitive user**, I want to see my WPM and accuracy improvements over time so that I can track my progress.

**As a user building endurance**, I want to see how my session length and break patterns improve so that I feel accomplished about my stamina building.

**As a creative user**, I want to identify and revisit my favorite story snippets so that I can appreciate my creative output.

**As a user with specific weaknesses**, I want to see improvement in targeted skills (like punctuation or problem keys) so that I know my practice is effective.

## Content & Monetization

**As a casual user**, I want to see highlights of my stories without paying so that I can enjoy the basic experience.

**As an engaged user**, I want the option to save my complete stories by watching an ad so that I can keep my writing without paying.

**As a premium user**, I want to automatically save all my stories so that I can build a collection of my creative work.

**As a user who completed a great session**, I want to download a save file with both my story and the animation that inspired it so that I can share or revisit my creative work.

**As a user with saved session files**, I want to upload and replay my previous sessions in the app so that I can relive my favorite writing moments without needing to save images separately.

## Cross-Platform Experience

**As a mobile user**, I want the same smooth experience on my iPhone so that I can practice anywhere.

**As a desktop user**, I want the full experience in my browser so that I can practice with a full keyboard.

**As a multi-device user**, I want my progress to sync seamlessly so that I can switch between devices without losing continuity.

## Accessibility & Usability

**As a user with hand fatigue concerns**, I want break timing that adapts to my needs so that I can practice safely.

**As a user new to creative typing**, I want clear but unobtrusive guidance so that I understand how to engage with the practice elements.

**As a user who gets distracted easily**, I want the narrative flow to help maintain my focus so that I can practice for longer periods effectively.
